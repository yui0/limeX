=== NEW: MICROWINDOWS AND FLTK PORTED TO THE ANDROID PLATFORM === 

Microwindows or Nano-X is a small, Xlib compatible library. It is
Open Source and licenced under the the Mozilla Public License.
The main GUI toolkit that can be used with Microwindows is FLTK. 

Areas where Microwindows can be used are:

* provide an excellent GUI for small embedded devices with FLTK
* port the FLTK GUI toolkit to new platforms
* linking an application with Microwindows can provide it with a GUI 
  on console based Linux distros
* provide Xlib support for platforms without Xlib

Microwindows features two APIs: Nano-X/NX11 which provides an 
X11 compatible API and MWIN which is compatible to the Win32 API.

It is very portable, is written in C and can be used on a wide range 
of platforms. 
Currently it is available for Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, Android, DOS, 
uclinux, RTEMS, ELKS, PSP and more. 
It can be compiled for x86, x86_64, ARM, PowerPC and MIPS processors.

Microwindows has a layered design. At the lowest level there are drivers 
for screen output as well as mouse and keyboard input. Touch input 
devices are also supported. Drivers are available for X11, frame buffer, 
the Allegro graphics library, VESA or the SVGA library. Additional 
drivers can be added to port Microwindows to more platforms.

At the mid level, a portable graphics engine is implemented, providing 
support for line draws, area fills, polygons, clipping and color models. 

At the upper level, the Nano-X/NX11 and MWIN API's are implemented 
providing access to the graphics applications programmer. 

Nano-X can be compiled either as a separate server for several clients 
or linked together to a single, standalone library.

The main Nano-X web site is at http://www.microwindows.org

To build Microwindows, see the files /src/INSTALL and /src/CONTENTS 
plus the faq files in the doc directory.

An HTML based FAQ and Architecture document are available from the web site.

The chief maintainer of the project is Greg Haerr <greg@censoft.com>

Microwindows and Nano-X are discussed on the NanoGUI mailing list.
