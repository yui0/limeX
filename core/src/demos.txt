-----------------------------------------------------
This is an overview of the demo programs provided. 
These can be found in the bin directory after executing "make".

If compiled with shared=N and link_app_into_server=Y
the demos can be called from src directory with e.g.
"./bin/demo6 landmine.ppm"

Otherwise use a shell script and load nano-X
and nanowm before the application. E.g.:
"bin/nano-X -N & bin/nanowm & bin/tuxchess".

There are a number of shell scripts in the src/demoscripts
directory. 

There is also a rundemos.sh script in the src/ and bin/
directories which can be used to run the demos. Select
a demo from the list or enter it on the command line.
