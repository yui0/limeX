DEPRECATED FILES AND DRIVERS	07/30/2011

After v0.92, the internal drawing model has changed slightly.
Instead of having screen drivers implement drawpixel, drawhline,
drawvline etc themselves, the system always uses one of the fblinearXX.c
drawing routines which draws directly into the framebuffer, or
when not present, a memory framebuffer that is later updated
on systems without a framebuffer using the new psd->Update
routine.  Thus, a blit (block memory copy) is all that is
required for non-framebuffer based systems.  This allows 
Microwindows to draw text and images very fast through
its own conversion blit routines, a big speed improvement
from 0.92.

Because of this, screen drivers that had their own screen
routines for drawpixel, drawhline etc have been deprecated.
If wanted, these drivers could be changed by removing all
the custom drawline code and adding an Update blit routine,
similar to the way the X11 scr_x11.c driver was rewritten.
