How to execute the programs depends on the settings in the config file.

If LINK_APP_INTO_SERVER was set to "N" when you compiled the programs then 
you have to run the scripts included to execute the programs.

Otherwise you can click on the program name in your file manager or enter e.g.
./xhello on the command line. If SHAREDLIBS had been set to "Y" you have to 
execute "sudo make install" in the microwindows/src directory first before 
executing the programs. Otherwise the programs won't find the required "*.so.0" libraries
in usr/lib or usr/lib64.

If LINK_APP_INTO_SERVER is set to "Y", the programs are compiled with the "-PIC" parameter
which is included in the LDFLAGS variable. Otherwise the programs will crash.
