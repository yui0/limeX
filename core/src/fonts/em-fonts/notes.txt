To save disc space there are only the fonts in fonts.dir.

This means, using the fonts alias file, 
the dejavu bold oblique font is mapped to bold normal.
the courier italic and bold italic fonts are mapped to normal and bold.
the fixed system font - if used ? - is mapped to a non-fixed dejavu font.

So if you select a font in fltk, the result will not always be correct,
since some fonts are mapped to different fonts using the fonts.alias file.

To extend fonts enter them in the fonts.dir file and update the font.alias
file.
